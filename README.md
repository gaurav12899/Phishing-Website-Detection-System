# Phishing-Website-Detection-System
Phishing is a form of fraud in which the attacker tries to learn sensitive information such as login credentials or account information by sending as a reputable entity or person in email or other communication channels. Typically a victim receives a message that appears to have been sent by a known contact or organization. The message contains malicious software targeting the userâ€™s computer or has links to direct victims to malicious websites in order to trick them into divulging personal and financial information, such as passwords, account IDs or credit card details.
